Hello, my name is Satya Sai Sribhashyam and PSID is 1855846.

While the three of us helped each other wrinting the answer, I specifically worked on the first question.

The part I worked on::

1. Discuss your initial thoughts in detail on how you will design this application? (2 points)

      The building process will be focused more on user functionality and usability meaning we will be making a user-friendly interface design. 

      We are planning on using tools such as SQL, HTML and CSS for the front-end design. For the back-end we are planning to use python and C++ with compilers/integrated development environment such as Pycharm and Visual Studio Code. As for the website UI design we will be using tools such as Adobe XD and Photoshop. 

      We are planning to use MySQL to create a database to keep track of all data from the users and have a good profile management system.

      The website design/software will include a modular login system that allows for user authentication and also lets new users to create an account in the website.

      We hope to use the APIs to get fuel quotes for any particular location the user requests and provide it accordingly.

      We will be making data sheet of all the user fuel history, which will help us to keep track of all the transactions done using the application.
